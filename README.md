# NoteTaker

## Hello Welcome to the readMe. page.
The motivation behind this page was to make my first JSON website.  It also saves notes for class!
## What I learned
Through this project I learned:
* More about parsing data.
* How to use js.express way better!
* that you can basically hold a website together with express.
* More about routing and how it works with json websites
* That time invested was time well spent and I learned more and feel more confident
  
## Being new to web development I came across some issues you may see obvious such as:
* Taking a long time looking up the logic of this code.
 * Understanding what everything does.
* how to launch the site with Heroku. My account got locked out
